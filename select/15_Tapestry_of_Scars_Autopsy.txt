THE RAZOR SLID ACROSS MY SKIN
A CRIMSON KISS, A DECORATION
I LIKED THE WAY THE RED LEAKED OUT
THAT DAY MY NEW LIFE DID BEGIN
A MASOCHIST IN OTHERS WORDS
BUT THEY DON'T HEAR WHAT I HAVE HEARD
SIGHS OF RELEASE FROM PLASMA TRAILS
VISCOUS PATTERNS IN VIVID DETAIL
CARVING SYMBOLS SLOW AND DEEP
SEPERATING FLESH TO SEEP
WHEN I CUT MY SOUL'S REVEALED
CLEAN IS UGLY, ONLY SCARS ARE REAL
JIGSAW SCALPING, HEALING, SCABBING
NEW LACERATIONS, PICKING, STABBING
RIVERS OF BLOOD, INFINITE CUTS
SURFACES COVERED, IT'S NEVER ENOUGH
RIVERS OF BLOOD, INFINITE CUTS
SURFACES COVERED, IT'S NEVER ENOUGH
FINGERPRINTS SLOWLY ERASED
GRIND THEM OFF WITHOUT A TRACE
I HAVE BECOME A HUMAN SORE
A WORK OF ART FOREVER MORE
I HONE MY CRAFT WITH DEFT PRECISION
THE FLAYING KNIFE IS MY RELIGION
